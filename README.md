I’m sorry that the suggestion didn’t meet your expectations. Let me try again and provide you with a better solution!

GitHub README files don't support live animations or interactive JavaScript (like a snake running directly within the README itself), but I can guide you on how to make it visually appealing with clever workarounds. Here’s a more **interactive**, **dynamic**, and fun version using available GitHub capabilities, like **GIFs**, **shields**, and **commit animations**.

### Here’s the new version for your profile:
